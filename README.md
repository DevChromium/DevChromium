### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lucas, also known online as Chromium on all my social media profiles.
From a very young age I had interest in programming and creating small little website projects and then proudly showing them to my parents. I started learning HTMl and CSS when I was 12 years old, and after a few years later I started learning Javascript together with Node.JS. Eventually I started using Typescript more often in my projects and learnt PHP to work at Wynntils as a Web Developer.

Next september I am starting my bachelor degree in Computer Science, this will allow me to make even more cooler stuff.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Wynntils
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PHP and TypeScript
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach me through Discord (Chromium#6584) or via Twitter (@chromium__)
- âš¡ Fun fact: My dream job is being a Full-stack developer.
