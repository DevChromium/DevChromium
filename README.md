### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lucas also known as Chromium on all my social media profiles.
When I was little my only activities were being on the computer and play games, this eventually grew to an intrest to learn how to make websites. I started learning HTML and CSS when I was 12 years old, after a few months I stopped learning because I didn't have the motivation anymore to code websites so I went back to gaming but the intrest stayed. 5 Years passed and I started learning Node.JS and Typescript and I had an intrest in learning Javascript, this was the start of a new adventure and I regained motivation to start learning how to make websites with Vue.JS, I also have learnt some PHP to help create Wynntils' website.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Wynntils
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PHP and TypeScript
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach me through Discord (Chromium#6584) or via Twitter (@chromium__)
- âš¡ Fun fact: My dream job is being a Full-stack developer.
